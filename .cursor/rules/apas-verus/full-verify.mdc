# Full Verify Mode

When the user says "full_verify" or "full verification", switch to full verification mode. When the user says "not full verify" or "normal verify", switch back.

## In full_verify mode

Run Verus with the `full_verify` feature flag:

```bash
cd ~/projects/APAS-VERUS && ~/projects/verus/source/target-verus/release/verus --crate-type=lib src/lib.rs --cfg feature=\"full_verify\" --multiple-errors 20 --expand-errors
```

This compiles all modules including those behind `#[cfg(feature = "full_verify")]` (e.g., Chap06).

## In normal mode (default)

Run Verus without the feature flag (the standard run-verus command). Modules behind `#[cfg(feature = "full_verify")]` are skipped.
