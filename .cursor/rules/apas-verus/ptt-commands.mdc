# PTT Commands

Full documentation: `docs/ProofTimeTest.md`

Always use the shell scripts. Do not type raw commands.

## When to write PTTs

Only create PTTs for two cases:

1. **Iterator verification** — confirm that a module's iterators prove correctly
   (loop-match, for-iter, for-consuming, etc.).
2. **Complicated callability** — when a function's `requires` clause is complex
   and you're not confident callers can satisfy it, write a PTT exercising the call.

Do not create PTTs speculatively or for simple functions with straightforward specs.

## ptt — compile + run proof time tests

```bash
scripts/ptt.sh
```

With filter: `scripts/ptt.sh Chap05`

The script compiles the library with `--export` (absolute path) then runs PTTs.
Always compile first. Stale `.rlib` or `.vir` causes mysterious failures.

## rtt — run time tests

```bash
scripts/rtt.sh
```

With filter: `scripts/rtt.sh Chap50`
