# Review Against Prose

When working on `src/ChapNN/`, check if `prompts/ChapNN.txt` exists. If it does, read it before making changes or reviewing the code.

## When to Read

- Starting work on a chapter
- Reviewing specs or spec strength
- Implementing new algorithms
- Checking coverage of prose algorithms vs code

## What the File Contains

The `prompts/ChapNN.txt` file is extracted text from the APAS textbook chapter. It contains:

- Data type definitions
- Algorithm pseudocode
- Cost specifications (work and span)
- Correctness arguments
- Theorems and properties

## How to Use

1. Read `prompts/ChapNN.txt`
2. Identify all named definitions, algorithms, cost specs, and theorems
3. Compare against the code in `src/ChapNN/`
4. Note gaps: algorithms not implemented, specs weaker than what the prose describes, cost mismatches

This is the source of truth for what the code should implement and specify.
