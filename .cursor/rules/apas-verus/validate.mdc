# Validation Modes

Always use the shell scripts. Do not type raw verus commands.

## validate (default) — full verification

When the user says "validate", run:

```bash
scripts/validate.sh
```

## dev_only_validate — foundation modules only

When the user says "dev_only_validate" or "dov", run with the dev_only feature.
This skips all chapters and verifies only foundation (Types, Concurrency, vstdplus):

```bash
scripts/validate.sh dev_only
```

To include specific chapters in dev_only mode, edit `src/lib.rs` and change their cfg from:
```rust
#[cfg(not(any(feature = "experiments_only", feature = "dev_only")))]
```
to:
```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = "experiments_only"))]
```

Remember to include transitive dependencies (see dependency table in lib.rs comments).

## V1 — validate once

When the user says "V1", run a single Verus verification. If working with `experiments_only`:

```bash
scripts/validate.sh exp
```

Otherwise, same as validate. Do not iterate or fix errors. Just run once, show the full output, and stop.
