# Emacs Editor and File Context

## User Edits in Emacs

The user has been using Emacs for 50+ years and will edit files in Emacs, not in Cursor. Assume the user is actively editing in Emacs during the conversation.

## Read Before Editing

- **Always read the current file** before making edits, especially when discussing a specific file or when the user has had time to make changes.
- Do not rely on stale context from earlier in the conversation. The on-disk state may have changed.
- Use the Read tool to get the latest contents before applying search_replace or write.

## Avoid Overwriting User Changes

- Do not overwrite changes the user has made in Emacs.
- If the user has modified a file since your last read, your edit could clobber their work.
- When in doubt, read the file first. If your proposed edit conflicts with recent user edits, ask or adjust.

## Interaction

- Treat the conversation as collaborative: the user may be editing in parallel.
- Propose edits that fit the current state of the file, not an outdated view.
