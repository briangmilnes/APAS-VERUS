# No Parallel Test Suites

**Never** run RTTs and PTTs simultaneously. The desktop has memory limits that cause failures when both suites run at the same time.

## Rule

- Run RTTs first, wait for completion.
- Then run PTTs, wait for completion.
- Never launch both in parallel tool calls.

## Applies to

- `./scripts/rtt.sh` / `cargo nextest run`
- `./scripts/ptt.sh` / `scripts/pttest.py`
- Any merge phase that runs both suites
