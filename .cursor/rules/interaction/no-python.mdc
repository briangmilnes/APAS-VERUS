# No Python

**NEVER write Python scripts** for anything that will be used more than once.

- All reusable tools, scripts, and utilities must be written in **Rust**.
- If a tool is needed, the USER will take the output and specification into another agent (on `~/projects/veracity`) and make that tool.
- The user will then come back and show you how to use that tool.
- You must have the user's **explicit permission** to write even a throwaway Python script.
- When in doubt, write Rust.
