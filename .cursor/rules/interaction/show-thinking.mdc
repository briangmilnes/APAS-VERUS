# Always Show Thinking

When working on tasks, show reasoning explicitly in the response text, not just in hidden thinking blocks.

Before taking action, briefly explain:
- What you're about to do and why
- Key decisions or alternatives considered
- What you expect to happen

This helps the user follow the reasoning without expanding collapsed "thought N sec" bubbles.

Keep explanations concise but informative. One or two sentences is usually enough.
