# Tables in Cursor

By default, **present tables in Cursor chat** (in the response text).

- **DO**: Render tables as markdown in the response so the user sees them directly.
- **DO NOT**: Write tables to `.md` files unless the user explicitly asks for an md file.

## When the user wants an md file

The user will say so, e.g.:
- "write that to a file"
- "save as md"
- "put it in analyses/"
- "create an md file"

Only then write the table (or full report) to disk.
