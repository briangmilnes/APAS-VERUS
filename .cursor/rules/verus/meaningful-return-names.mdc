# Meaningful Return Names

In Verus function signatures, name return values meaningfully rather than using generic names like `result`.

## Good

```rust
fn n_plus(&self, v: &V) -> (out_neighbors: SetStEph<V>)
fn size(&self) -> (count: N)
fn empty() -> (graph: Self)
fn mem(&self, x: &T) -> (contains: B)
```

## Bad

```rust
fn n_plus(&self, v: &V) -> (result: SetStEph<V>)
fn size(&self) -> (result: N)
fn empty() -> (result: Self)
fn mem(&self, x: &T) -> (result: B)
```

## Exception

Files in `src/experiments/` may use `result` - these are throwaway explorations.

## Why

1. Named returns appear in ensures clauses - meaningful names make specs readable
2. `ensures out_neighbors@ == self.spec_n_plus(v@)` is clearer than `ensures result@ == ...`
3. The name documents what the function returns without reading the body
