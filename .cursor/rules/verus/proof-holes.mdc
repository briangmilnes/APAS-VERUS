# Check for Proof Holes

When you think you have completed a proof, run the proof hole detector to ensure there are no unverified assumptions:

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-proof-holes -d src/
```

Or for a specific file:

```bash
~/projects/veracity/target/release/veracity-review-proof-holes -d src/Chap05/
```

## What It Detects

| Hole Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `assume(false)` | Assumes a contradiction (proves anything) |
| `assume(...)` | Assumes arbitrary conditions without proof |
| `admit()` | Explicitly admits without proof |
| `#[verifier::external_body]` | Body not verified |
| `#[verifier::external_fn_specification]` | External function spec |
| `#[verifier::external]` | Fully external |

## When to Run

- After completing a proof function
- Before committing proof work
- When claiming a module is "proven"
- When the user says "show proof holes" - run the tool and discuss the results

## Understanding Results

- **Clean**: No unverified assumptions - the proof is complete
- **Holed**: Contains at least one proof hole - more work needed

A proof is not truly complete until it reports as clean.
