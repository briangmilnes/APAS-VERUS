# Running Verus

Always use the shell scripts. Do not type raw verus commands.

```bash
scripts/validate.sh
```

Use this when:
- Checking if code verifies
- After making changes to proofs or implementations
- Before committing changes

See `validate.mdc` for dev_only and experiments_only modes.

## Important

- **Never use `cargo verus`, `cargo build`, or any cargo-based compilation** for verification.
- Verus includes its own vstd automatically — do not pass `-L dependency`, `--extern vstd`, or any library paths.
- There is no need for `target/debug/` or `target/release/` directories for verification. Verus manages its own dependencies.

## Output Display

Always show the full output from verus verification:
- Use `head -100` to limit to 100 lines if needed
- Never use `grep` to filter verus output
- Show complete verification results including all errors and warnings
- **Always echo the output into your response text as a markdown code block** - do not rely on the terminal widget which collapses output
