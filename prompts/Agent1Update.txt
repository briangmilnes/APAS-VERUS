Read senior-proof-engineer.mdc (from .cursor/rules).
Read senior-prose-engineer.mdc (from .cursor/rules).
REREAD ANY FILES BEFORE MODIFYING THEM as I modify files in emacs. 

Update your chapter's analyses:
  veracity-review-verus-proof-holes.log - by program veracity-review-proof-holes

Do not review-against-prose.md to start, it's too costly for this.

You are working in src/Chap40.
These files have not been fully verusifided. 
They need traits with specs.
They need their functions proven.

Do them in this order:
BSTKeyValueStEph.rs
BSTReducedStEph.rs
BSTSizeStEph.rs

DOT.


Then review-against-prose.md.
Does the chapter say these are multithreaded?
Are the specs good?
