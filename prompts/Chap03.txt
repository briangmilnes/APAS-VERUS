 Implement insertion sort in a src/Chap3 directory,
 Name it InsertionSortSt.rs
 Use arrays of a generic type with Ord, not StT.
 Use slices.
 Write test code and bench code in
 tests/Chap3 and benches/Chap3.
 Show me an estimated time and the to-do list before you
 execute.
 


Example 3.1 (Insertion Sort). In this book, we describe algorithms by using the pseudo-
code notation based on SPARC, the language used in this book. For example, we can
specify the classic insertion sort algorithm as follows.
insSort f s =
if |s| = 0 then
〈 〉
else insert f s[0] (insSort f (s[1, ..., n − 1]))

In the algorithm, f is the comparison function and s is the input sequence. The algorithm
uses a function (insert f x s) that takes the comparison function f , an element x, and a
sequence s sorted by f , and inserts x in the appropriate place. Inserting into a sorted se-
quence is itself an algorithmic problem, since we are not specifying how it is implemented,
but just specifying its functionality.
