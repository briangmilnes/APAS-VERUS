Chapter 5
Sets and Relations
This chapter presents a review of some basic definitions on sets and relations.
1 Sets
A set is a collection of distinct objects. The objects that are contained in a set, are called mem-
bers or the elements of the set. The elements of a set must be distinct: a set may not contain
the same element more than once. The set that contains no elements is called the empty
set and is denoted by {} or ∅.
Specification of Sets. Sets can be specified intentionally, by mathematically describing
their members. For example, the set of natural numbers, traditionally written as N, can
be specified intentionally as the set of all nonnegative integral numbers. Sets can also be
specified extensionally by listing their members. For example, the set N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. We
say that an element x is a member of A, written x ∈ A, if x is in A. More generally, sets can
be specified using set comprehensions, which offer a compact and precise way to define
sets by mixing intentional and extensional notation.
Definition 5.1 (Union and Intersection). For two sets A and B, the union A ∪ B is defined
as the set containing all the elements of A and B. Symmetrically, their intersection, A ∩ B
is the defined as the set containing the elements that are member of both A and B. We say
that A and B are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set, i.e., A ∩ B = ∅.
Definition 5.2 (Cartesian Product). Consider two sets A and B. The Cartesian product
A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B, i.e.,
A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} .

1. SETS 31
Example 5.1. The Cartesian product of A = {0, 1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b} is
A × B = { (0, a), (0, b), (1, a), (1, b),
(2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)
}.
Definition 5.3 (Set Partition). Given a set A, a partition of A is a set P of non-empty subsets
of A such that each element of A is in exactly one subset in P . We refer to each element of
P as a block or a part and the set P as a partition of A. More precisely, P is a partition of
A if the following conditions hold:
• if B ∈ P , then B 6 = ∅,
• if A = ⋃
B∈P B, and
• if B, C ∈ P , then B = C or B ∩ C = ∅.
Example 5.2. If A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} then P = {{1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}} is a partition of A. The set
{1, 3, 5} is a block.
The set Q = {{1, 3, 5, 6}, {2, 4, 6}} is a not partition of A, because the element 6 is contained
multiple blocks.
Definition 5.4 (Kleene Operators). For any set Σ, its Kleene star Σ∗ is the set of all possible
strings consisting of members of Σ, including the empty string.
For any set Σ, its Kleene plus Σ+ is the set of all possible strings consisting of members Σ,
excluding the empty string.
Example 5.3. Given Σ = {a, b},
Σ∗ = { ’ ’,
’ a ’, ’ b ’,
’ aa ’, ’ ab ’, ’ ba ’, ’ bb ’,
’ aaa ’, ’ aab ’, ’ aba ’, ’ abb ’,
’ baa ’, ’ bab ’, ’ bba ’, ’ bbb ’,
. . .
}
and
Σ+ = { ’ a ’, ’ b ’,
’ aa ’, ’ ab ’, ’ ba ’, ’ bb ’,
’ aaa ’, ’ aab ’, ’ aba ’, ’ abb ’,
’ baa ’, ’ bab ’, ’ bba ’, ’ bbb ’,
. . .
}
Exercise 5.1. Prove that Kleene star and Kleene plus are closed under string concatenation.

2 Relations
Definition 5.5 (Relation). A (binary) relation from a set A to set B is a subset of the
Cartesian product of A and B. For a relation R ⊆ A × B,
• the set {a : (a, b) ∈ R} is referred to as the domain of R, and
• the set {b : (a, b) ∈ R} is referred to as the range of R.
Definition 5.6 (Function). A mapping or function from A to B is a relation R ⊂ A × B
such that |R| = |domain(R)|, i.e., for every a in the domain of R there is only one b such
that (a, b) ∈ R. The range of the function is the range of R. We call the set A the domain
and the B the co-domain of the function.
Example 5.4. Consider the sets A = {0, 1, 2, 3} and B = {a, b}.
The set:
X = {(0, a), (0, b), (1, b), (3, a)}
is a relation from A to B since X ⊂ A × B, but not a mapping (function) since 0 is repeated.
The set
Y = {(0, a), (1, b), (3, a)}
is both a relation and a function from A to B since each element only appears once on the
left.
