Chapter 6
Graph Theory
This chapter presents an overview of basic graph theory used throughout the book. This
chapter does not aim to be complete (and is far from it) but tries to cover the most relevant
material to the course. More details can be found in standard texts.
1 Basic Definitions
Definition 6.1 (Directed Graph). A directed graph or ( digraph) is a pair G = (V, A) where
• V is a set of vertices, and
• A ⊆ V × V is a set of directed edges or arcs.
Note. In a digraph, each arc is an ordered pair e = (u, v). A digraph can have self
loops (u, u).
Definition 6.2 (Undirected graph). An undirected graph is a pair G = (V, E) where
• V is a set of vertices (or nodes), and
• E ⊆ (V
2
) is a set of edges.
Note. Given a set V , a k-combination of V is a subset of k distinct elements of V . The
notation
(V
k
)
denotes the set of all k-combinations of the set V .

Therefore, in an undirected graph, each edge is an unordered pair e = {u, v} (or equiva-
lently {v, u}) and there cannot be self loops ({v, v} = {v} 6 ∈ (V
2
)).
Example 6.1. An example directed graph with 4 vertices:

Wikipedia):
Remark. While directed graphs represent possibly asymmetric relationships, undirected
graphs represent symmetric relationships. Directed graphs are therefore more general than
undirected graphs because an undirected graph can be represented by a directed graph by
replacing an edge with two arcs, one in each direction.
Graphs come with a lot of terminology, but fortunately most of it is intuitive once we
understand the concept. In this section, we consider graphs that do not have any data
associated with edges, such as weights. In the next section, we consider weighted graphs,
where the weights on edges can represent a distance, a capacity or the strength of the
connection.
Definition 6.3 (Neighbors). A vertex u is a neighbor of, or equivalently adjacent to, a
vertex v in a graph G = (V, E) if there is an edge {u, v} ∈ E. For a directed graph a vertex
u is an in-neighbor of a vertex v if (u, v) ∈ E and an out-neighbor if (v, u) ∈ E. We also
say two edges or arcs are neighbors if they share a vertex.
Definition 6.4 (Neighborhood). For an undirected graph G = (V, E), the neighborhood NG(v)
of a vertex v ∈ V is its set of all neighbors of v, i.e., NG(v) = {u | {u, v} ∈ E}. For a directed
1. BASIC DEFINITIONS 35
graph we use N +
G (v) to indicate the set of out-neighbors and N −
G (v) to indicate the set of
in-neighbors of v. If we use NG(v) for a directed graph, we mean the out neighbors.
The neighborhood of a set of vertices U ⊆ V is the union of their neighborhoods, e.g.,
• NG(U ) = ⋃
u∈U NG(y), or
• N +
G (U ) = ⋃
u∈U N +
G (u).
Definition 6.5 (Incidence). We say an edge is incident on a vertex if the vertex is one of its
endpoints. Similarly we say a vertex is incident on an edge if it is one of the endpoints of
the edge.
Definition 6.6 (Degree). The degree dG(v) of a vertex v ∈ V in a graph G = (V, E) is the
size of the neighborhood |NG(v)|. For directed graphs we use in-degree d−
G(v) = |N −
G (v)|
and out-degree d+
G(v) = |N +
G (v)|. We will drop the subscript G when it is clear from the
context which graph we’re talking about.
Definition 6.7 (Path). A path in a graph is a sequence of adjacent vertices. More formally
for a graph G = (V, E), we define the set of all paths in G, written Paths(G) as
Paths(G) = {P ∈ V + | 1 ≤ i < |P |, (Pi, Pi+1) ∈ E} ,
where V + indicates all positive length sequences of vertices (allowing for repeats). The
length of a path is one less than the number of vertices in the path—i.e., it is the number of
edges in the path. A path in a finite graph can have infinite length. A simple path is a path
with no repeated vertices. Please see the remark below, however.
Remark. Some authors use the terms walk for path, and path for simple path. Even in this
book when it is clear from the context we will sometimes drop the “simple” from simple
path.
Definition 6.8 (Reachability and connectivity). In a graph G, a vertex u can reach another
vertex v if there is a path in G that starts at u and ends at v. If u can reach v, we also say
that v is reachable from u. We use RG(u) to indicate the set of all vertices reachable from
u in G. Note that in an undirected graph reachability is symmetric: if u can reach v, then v
can reach u.
We say that an undirected graph is connected if all vertices are reachable from all other
vertices. We say that a directed graph is strongly connected if all vertices are reachable
from all other vertices.
Definition 6.9 (Cycles). In a directed graph a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the
same vertex. A cycle can have length one (i.e. a self loop). A simple cycle is a cycle
that has no repeated vertices other than the start and end vertices being the same. In an
undirected graph a simple cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, has no
repeated vertices other than the first and last, and has length at least three. In this course
we will exclusively talk about simple cycles and hence, as with paths, we will often drop
simple.
Exercise 6.1. Why is important in a undirected graph to require that a cycle has length at
least three? Why is important that we do not allow repeated vertices?
36 CHAPTER 6. GRAPH THEORY
Definition 6.10 (Trees and forests). An undirected graph with no cycles is a forest. A
forest that is connected is a tree. A directed graph is a forest (or tree) if when all edges are
converted to undirected edges it is undirected forest (or tree). A rooted tree is a tree with
one vertex designated as the root. For a directed graph the edges are typically all directed
toward the root or away from the root.
Definition 6.11 (Directed acyclic graphs). A directed graph with no cycles is a directed
acyclic graph (DAG).
Definition 6.12 (Distance). The distance δG(u, v) from a vertex u to a vertex v in a graph
G is the shortest path (minimum number of edges) from u to v. It is also referred to as
the shortest path length from u to v.
Definition 6.13 (Diameter). The diameter of a graph G is the maximum shortest path
length over all pairs of vertices in G, i.e., max {δG(u, v) : u, v ∈ V }.
Definition 6.14 (Multigraphs). Sometimes graphs allow multiple edges between the same
pair of vertices, called multi-edges. Graphs with multi-edges are called multi-graphs. We
will allow multi-edges in a couple algorithms just for convenience.
Definition 6.15 (Sparse and Dense Graphs). We will use the following conventions:
n = |V |
m = |E|
Note that a directed graph can have at most n2 edges (including self loops) and an undi-
rected graph at most n(n − 1)/2. We informally say that a graph is sparse if m  n2
and dense otherwise. In most applications graphs are very sparse, often with only a hand-
ful of neighbors per vertex when averaged across vertices, although some vertices could
have high degree. Therefore, the emphasis in the design of graph algorithms, at least for
this book, is on algorithms that work well for sparse graphs.
Definition 6.16 (Enumerable graphs). In some cases, it is possible to label the vertices of
the graphs with natural numbers starting from 0. More precisely, an enumerable graph is
a graph G = (V, E) where V = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. Enumerable graphs can be more efficient
to represent than general graphs.
2 Weighted Graphs
Many applications of graphs require associating weights or other values with the edges of
a graph.
Definition 6.17 (Weighted and Edge-Labeled Graphs). An edge-labeled graph or a weighted
graph is a triple G = (E, V, w) where w : E → L is a function mapping edges or directed
edges to their labels (weights) , and L is the set of possible labels (weights).
In a graph, if the data associated with the edges are real numbers, we often use the term
“weight” to refer to the edge labels, and use the term “weighted graph” to refer to the

graph. In the general case, we use the terms “edge label” and edge-labeled graph. Weights
or other values on edges could represent many things, such as a distance, or a capacity, or
the strength of a relationship.
Example 6.2. An example directed weighted graph.
Remark. As it may be expected, basic terminology on graphs defined above straightfor-
wardly extend to weighted graphs.
3 Subgraphs
When working with graphs, we sometimes wish to refer to parts of a graph. To this end,
we can use the notion of a subgraph, which refers to a graph contained in a larger graph.
A subgraph can be defined as any subsets of edges and vertices that together constitute a
well defined graph.
Definition 6.18 (Subgraph). Let G = (V, E) and H = (V ′, E′) be two graphs. H is a
subgraph of if V ′ ⊆ V and E′ ⊆ E.
Note. Note that since H is a graph, the vertices defining each edge are in the vertex set V ′,
i.e., for an undirected graph E′ ⊆ (V ′
2
). There are many possible subgraphs of a graph.
An important class of subgraphs are vertex-induced subgraphs, which are maximal sub-
graphs defined by a set of vertices. A vertex-induced subgraph is maximal in the sense that
it contains all the edges that it can possibly contain. In general when an object is said to be
a maximal “X”, it means that nothing more can be added to the object without violating
the property “X”.
Definition 6.19 (Vertex-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by V ′ ⊆
V is the graph H = (V ′, E′) where E′ = {{u, v} ∈ E | u ∈ V ′, v ∈ V ′}.
Example 6.3. Some vertex induced subgraphs:

38 CHAPTER 6. GRAPH THEORY
Original graph
Induced by {a, b, c, e, f}
Induced by {a, b, c, d}
We can alno define an induced subgraph in terms of a set of edges by including in the
graph all the vertices incident on the edges.
Definition 6.20 (Edge-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by E′ ⊆ E
is a graph H = (V ′, E′) where V ′ = ∪e∈E e.
4 Connectivity
Recall that in a graph (either directed or undirected) a vertex v is reachable from a vertex u
if there is a path from u to v. Also recall that an undirected graph is connected if all vertices
are reachable from all other vertices.
Example 6.4. Two example graphs shown. The first in connected; the second is not.

5. GRAPH PARTITION 39
Graph 1
Graph 2
An important subgraph of an undirected graph is a connected component of a graph, de-
fined below.
Definition 6.21 (Connected Component). Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. A sub-
graph H of G is a connected component of G if it is a maximally connected subgraph of
G.
Here, “maximally connected component” means we cannot add any more vertices and
edges from G to H without disconnecting H. In the graphs shown in the example above,
the first graph has one connected component (hence it is connected); the second has two
connected components.
Note. We can specify a connected component of a graph by simply specifying the vertices
in the component. For example, the connected components of the second graph in the
example above can be specified as {a, b, c, d} and {e, f}.
5 Graph Partition
Recall that a partition of a set A is a set P of non-empty subsets of A such that each element
of A is in exactly one subset, also called block, B ∈ P .
Definition 6.22 (Graph Partition). A graph partition is a partition of the vertex set of the
graph. More precisely, given graph G = (V, E), we define a partition of G as a set of graphs
P = {G1 = (V1, E1) . . . Gk = (Vk, Ek)},

where {V1, . . . , Vk} is a (set) partition of V and G1, . . . , Gk are vertex-induced subgraphs of
G with respect to V1, . . . , Vk respectively. As in set partitions, we use the term part or block to
refer to each vertex-induced subgraph G1, . . . , Gk.
Definition 6.23 (Internal and Cut Edges). In a graph partition, we can distinguish between
two kinds of edges: internal edges and cut edges. Internal edges are edges that are within
a block; cut edges are edges that are between blocks. One way to partition a graph is
to make each connected component a block. In such a partition, there are no cut edges
between the partitions.
6 Trees
Definition 6.24 (Tree). An undirected graph is a tree if it does not have cycles and it is
connected. A rooted tree is a tree with a distinguished root node that can be used to access
all other nodes. An example of a rooted tree along with the associated terminology is given
in below.
Definition 6.25 (Rooted Trees). A rooted tree is a directed graph such that
1. One of the vertices is the root and it has no in edges.
2. All other vertices have one in-edge.
3. There is a path from the root to all other vertices.
Rooted trees are common structures in computing and have their own dedicated terminol-
ogy.
• By convention we use the term node instead of vertex to refer to the vertices of a
rooted tree.
• A node is a leaf if it has no out edges, and an internal node otherwise.
• For each directed edge (u, v), u is the parent of v, and v is a child of u.
• For each path from u to v (including the empty path with u = v), u is an ancestor of
v, and v is a descendant of u.
• For a vertex v, its depth is the length of the path from the root to v and its height is
the longest path from v to any leaf.
• The height of a tree is the height of its root.
• For any node v in a tree, the subtree rooted at v is the rooted tree defined by taking the
induced subgraph of all vertices reachable from v (i.e. the vertices and the directed
edges between them), and making v the root.

• As with graphs, an ordered rooted tree is a rooted tree in which the out edges (chil-
dren) of each node are ordered.
Example 6.5. An example rooted tree follows.
root : A
leaves : E, C, F , G, and H
internal nodes : A, B, and D
children of A : B, C and D
parent of E : B
descendants of A : all nodes, including A itself
ancestors of F : F , D and A
depth of F : 2
height of B : 1
height of the tree : 2
subtree rooted at D : the rooted tree consisting of D, F , G and H
