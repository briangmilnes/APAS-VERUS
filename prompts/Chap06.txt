 Wait for me to tell you when to fix, build and test.

3 Subgraphs

When working with graphs, we sometimes wish to refer to parts of a graph. To this end,
we can use the notion of a subgraph, which refers to a graph contained in a larger graph.
A subgraph can be defined as any subsets of edges and vertices that together constitute a
well defined graph.

Definition 6.18 (Subgraph). Let G = (V, E) and H = (V ′, E′) be two graphs. H is a
subgraph of if V ′ ⊆ V and E′ ⊆ E.
Note. Note that since H is a graph, the vertices defining each edge are in the vertex set V ′,
i.e., for an undirected graph E′ ⊆ (V ′
2
). There are many possible subgraphs of a graph.
An important class of subgraphs are vertex-induced subgraphs, which are maximal sub-
graphs defined by a set of vertices. A vertex-induced subgraph is maximal in the sense that
it contains all the edges that it can possibly contain. In general when an object is said to be
a maximal “X”, it means that nothing more can be added to the object without violating
the property “X”.

Definition 6.19 (Vertex-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by V ′ ⊆
V is the graph H = (V ′, E′) where E′ = {{u, v} ∈ E | u ∈ V ′, v ∈ V ′}.
Example 6.3. Some vertex induced subgraphs:

We can alno define an induced subgraph in terms of a set of edges by including in the
graph all the vertices incident on the edges.
Definition 6.20 (Edge-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by E′ ⊆ E
is a graph H = (V ′, E′) where V ′ = ∪e∈E e

We can alno define an induced subgraph in terms of a set of edges by including in the
graph all the vertices incident on the edges.

Definition 6.20 (Edge-Induced Subgraph). The subgraph of G = (V, E) induced by E′ ⊆ E
is a graph H = (V ′, E′) where V ′ = ∪e∈E e.


4 Connectivity
Recall that in a graph (either directed or undirected) a vertex v is reachable from a vertex u
if there is a path from u to v. Also recall that an undirected graph is connected if all vertices
are reachable from all other vertices.
Example 6.4. Two example graphs shown. The first in connected; the second is not.
5. GRAPH PARTITION 39
Graph 1
Graph 2
An important subgraph of an undirected graph is a connected component of a graph, de-
fined below.
Definition 6.21 (Connected Component). Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. A sub-
graph H of G is a connected component of G if it is a maximally connected subgraph of
G.
Here, “maximally connected component” means we cannot add any more vertices and
edges from G to H without disconnecting H. In the graphs shown in the example above,
the first graph has one connected component (hence it is connected); the second has two
connected components.
Note. We can specify a connected component of a graph by simply specifying the vertices
in the component. For example, the connected components of the second graph in the
example above can be specified as {a, b, c, d} and {e, f}.


5 Graph Partition
Recall that a partition of a set A is a set P of non-empty subsets of A such that each element
of A is in exactly one subset, also called block, B ∈ P .
Definition 6.22 (Graph Partition). A graph partition is a partition of the vertex set of the
graph. More precisely, given graph G = (V, E), we define a partition of G as a set of graphs
P = {G1 = (V1, E1) . . . Gk = (Vk, Ek)},
40 CHAPTER 6. GRAPH THEORY
where {V1, . . . , Vk} is a (set) partition of V and G1, . . . , Gk are vertex-induced subgraphs of
G with respect to V1, . . . , Vk respectively. As in set partitions, we use the term part or block to
refer to each vertex-induced subgraph G1, . . . , Gk.
Definition 6.23 (Internal and Cut Edges). In a graph partition, we can distinguish between
two kinds of edges: internal edges and cut edges. Internal edges are edges that are within
a block; cut edges are edges that are between blocks. One way to partition a graph is
to make each connected component a block. In such a partition, there are no cut edges
between the partitions.

6 Trees

Definition 6.24 (Tree). An undirected graph is a tree if it does not have cycles and it is
connected. A rooted tree is a tree with a distinguished root node that can be used to access
all other nodes. An example of a rooted tree along with the associated terminology is given
in below.

Definition 6.25 (Rooted Trees). A rooted tree is a directed graph such that
1. One of the vertices is the root and it has no in edges.
2. All other vertices have one in-edge.
3. There is a path from the root to all other vertices.
Rooted trees are common structures in computing and have their own dedicated terminol-
ogy.
• By convention we use the term node instead of vertex to refer to the vertices of a
rooted tree.
• A node is a leaf if it has no out edges, and an internal node otherwise.
• For each directed edge (u, v), u is the parent of v, and v is a child of u.
• For each path from u to v (including the empty path with u = v), u is an ancestor of
v, and v is a descendant of u.
• For a vertex v, its depth is the length of the path from the root to v and its height is
the longest path from v to any leaf.
• The height of a tree is the height of its root.
• For any node v in a tree, the subtree rooted at v is the rooted tree defined by taking the
induced subgraph of all vertices reachable from v (i.e. the vertices and the directed
edges between them), and making v the root.

• As with graphs, an ordered rooted tree is a rooted tree in which the out edges (chil-
dren) of each node are ordered.

Example 6.5. An example rooted tree follows.
