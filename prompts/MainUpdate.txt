 You updated your worktree but other agents may have touched your
  chapters by accident.
 You are working ONLY on Chap50-Chap66 when I have multiple agents up.
 You also work with me on large scale issues across the whole codebase.
 Verus has been updated.
 You can only work on a blocker outside of your chapters with my
 explicit permission.

 Run check-stale-reviews.sh to check which analyses on your
 chapter need to be updated.
 Propose a table of code fixes by priority.
