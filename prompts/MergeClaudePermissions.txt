 So we have
  ~/.claude/settings.json
  ~/projects/APAS-VERUS*/.claude/settings.local.json
 and
  ~/projects/APAS-VERUS*/CLAUDE.md.

And I made  ~/projects/APAS-VERUS-agent1/CLAUDE.md learn to always use the
 scripts/verify.sh scripts/rtt.sh scripts/ptt.sh.

And to not filter the output of scripts/verify.sh execpt by head -10.
If you don't read the output of the prover you have no idea what to prove.

Yet I still keep getting asked about permissions.

Review the file statuses.

If claude-code generates a settings.local.json do the permissions in
~/.claude/settings.json override?

How do we merge these?

And one agent just asked for permission for git:* and for veracity-review-proof-holes:*.
Why? What got put in settings.local.json that should be in ~/.claude/settings.json?
Or is it already?

And why can't you read from projects? Permit it.
